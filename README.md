# CRC-Error-Control
CRC-16 Error Control (Sender and Receiver side)

Implement CRC-16. Use socket to communicate between sender and receiver. Test case should include
i) Single bit error detection
ii) Two isolated single bit error detection
iii) Odd number of errors
iv) Burst error of different sizes (i.e. 8, 17, 22)
Error will be introduced in bit level. Use Manchester encoding scheme.

You can use C/C++ only. Implementations in any other language will be rejected firsthand.
